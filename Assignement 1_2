1. What should be the output of the following Script?
v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v%/%t)
        > v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
        > t <- c(8, 3, 4)
        > print(v%/%t)
        [1] 0 1 1

2. You have 25 excel files with names as xx_1.xlsx, xx_2.xlsx,........xx_25.xlsx in a dir.   
Write a program to extract the contents of each excel sheet and make it one df.
Ans – 
      setwd("Path containing your excel files")
      files-list.files(pattern=".xlsx")
      for(i in 1:length(files)) {
      filename-files[i]
      data-read.xlsx(file = filename.header-T)
      assign(x filename,value data)
      }

3. If the above 25 files were csv files, what would be your script to read?
Ans – 
      First we need to save the excel sheets into .csv files and import/read it using CSV method.
      setwd("Path containing your excel files")
      files-list.files(pattern=".csv") {
      for(i in 1:length(files))
      filename-files[i]
      data-read.csv(file = filename.header-T)
      assign(x filename,value data)
      }
